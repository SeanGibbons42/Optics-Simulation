# Optics-Simulation
Simple Jupyter notebook to demonstrate the use of the discrete/fast fourier transform
to simulate far-field [fraunhoffer diffraction].

### Running
Requires python 3.x, numpy, matplotlib, and Jupyter. With python 3.x properly installed,
run the following commands to install dependencies if they are not already installed:

```
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install matplotlib
python -m pip install jupyter
```

Please note if you are on Mac or Linux, you may have to use python3 instead of python:
```
python3 -m pip install numpy
python3 -m pip install matplotlib
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

Then, navigate to this directory using command prompt or terminal, and run the command `jupyter notebook`. You should be redirected the jupyter app running in your browser. From here you can open the file `fft_fun.ipynb`.

Alternativly, access this notebook on Microsoft Azure's notebook service:
